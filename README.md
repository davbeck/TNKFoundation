## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

TNKFoundation is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "TNKFoundation"
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate TNKFoundation into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "davbeck/TNKFoundation" ~> 0.3
```

Run `carthage` to build the framework and drag the built `TNKFoundation.framework` into your Xcode project.
